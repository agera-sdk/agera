> The SDK is in no usable state and is not released for use yet. No significant work has been put yet, therefore it currently does not include display, sound, touch, keyboard, gamepad, user interface and several other APIs that it must support.

## Development progress

Agera should feel similiar to Adobe AIR and Apache Flex, but using the entity-component-system pattern and containing additional built-in features.

- [Here are short plans](docs/plans.md)

Additional notes:

- *About the Rust language*: Developers must use the nightly Rust compiler to leverage language features, such as use of declarative macros and `try` blocks.

## Progress

Agera should feel similiar to Adobe AIR and Apache Flex, but using a hierarchical Entity-Component pattern and containing additional built-in features.

Additional notes:

- Rust: Developers must use the nightly Rust compiler to leverage language features, such as use of declarative macros and `try` blocks.

When getting started with the CLI, creating a fresh project will look like follows:

```sh
agera new com.q.a
```

A fresh application will not require manually adding common minor dependencies such as, say, regular expressions, collection literals and serialization, as Agera re-exports them as APIs.

# Inheritance

Agera uses the [`oop_inheritance`](https://libs.rs/crates/oop_inheritance) crate for defining Node classes. Refer to that crate's documentation for more details on fundamental class usage.

It can be imported without depending on `oop_inheritance` by the following `use` item:

```rust
use agera::util::inheritance::*;
```
